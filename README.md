# Detecting-Sleep-Apnea
Sleep apnea is a condition characterised by partial or complete blockage of the airway during sleep. If left undiagnosed, it can lead to serious health issues over time. Polysomnography is the conventional diagnostic technique, but it is quite time-consuming (the patient needs to spend a whole night at the sleep centre) as well as expensive.
Deep learning models such as Alexnet, Lenet, BiLSTM, Zfnet LSTM, and VGG19, as well as some hybrid models such as Alexnet-biLSTM, VGG19-LSTM, and Zfnet-LSTM, have been used for detecting sleep apnea, particularly Obstructive Sleep apnea, which is the most prevalent type of sleep apnea.
